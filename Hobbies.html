			<h3>Watching videos online</h3>
				<p>I love to watch videos online, especially about my favorite k-pop idols. I enjoy watching content like variety shows, music videos, dance videos, and many more.</p>
			<h3>Listening to music</h3>
				<p>I always listen to the music of my favorite artists and groups. It also helps me to stay focused on a task that I'm doing while jamming to it.</p>
			<h3>Eating</h3>
				<p>I love to eat, especially when I am frustrated, bored, and sad. I also always treat my family and friends when I want to eat something.</p>
			<h3>Taking pictures for memories</h3>
				<p>I'm also a person who doesn't take many pictures of myself when I'm going somewhere, but I always take pictures of the scenery and people that I am with.
				</p>
				<p>In the event that I want to reminisce about something, I always look to the pictures that I took.</p>
